  <h2> <center>A Secondhand Hound Success Story </em> </center>

  <h3> <center> <em>from Kentucky to Minnesota... </em> </center> </h3>

  <hr>

  <p>As a puppy he was plucked out of a high-kill dog pound in Kentucky and found
    himself in a van driving North.</p>

  <p> He arrived in Minnesota and had to be checked over by a vet before he
    could begin looking for a new,  <em>forever,</em>  home.</p>

  <p>Once I laid eyes on him, I knew his home was with me. </p>

    <li> find a patch of sun to curl up and nap in</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h4> His top 5 favorite foods:</h4>
    <ol>
    <li> chicken </li>
    <li> peanut butter</li>

  <p>Are you thinking about adding a furry friend to your family? There are numerous reasons why having a pet is beneficial for people and
    many reasons why <a href:"http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/adopt/tips/top_reasons_adopt.html"> adopting through a shelter or rescue organization </a> is the best way to go about it. </p>

<p> Arlo was adopted through Secondhand Hounds but there are many other local rescue groups with deserving animals waiting for a forever home.<p>
