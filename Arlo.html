  <h2 class="title">A Secondhand Hound Success Story</h2>

  <em>from Kentucky to Minnesota...</em>

  <hr>

  <p>As a puppy he was plucked out of a high-kill dog pound in Kentucky and found himself in a van driving North.</p>

  <p> Scared and alone, he arrived in Minnesota and had to be checked over by a vet before he could begin looking for a new, <em>forever,</em> home.</p>

  <p>Once I laid eyes on him, I knew his home was with me. </p>
