    <h2><center>A Secondhand Hound Success Story </em> </center>
  <p><h43> <em>from Kentucky to Minnesota... </em></h3>
    </p>


  <p>As a puppy he was plucked out of a high-kill dog pound in Kentucky and found himself in a van driving North.</p>

  <p> Once he arrived in Minnesota he had to be checked over by a vet before he could begin looking for a new,  <em>forever,</em>  home.</p>

  <p>Once I laid eyes on him, I knew his home was with me.
